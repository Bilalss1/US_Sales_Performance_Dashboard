# US_Sales_Performance_Dashboard
Interactive Excel dashboard analysing furniture sales across the USA. Includes KPIs, regional insights, shipping behaviour and product performance with slicer-driven filtering. The report focuses on sales performance, shipping behaviour and regional patterns, with a clean, single-page view for quick decision-making.

## Project Overview

This project turns a raw furniture sales dataset into an interactive Excel dashboard that answers:

- How much are we selling, and how profitable is it?
- Which regions and cities drive the most revenue?
- Which shipping modes are used most often, and how long do deliveries take?
- Which product categories contribute the highest sales?

The dashboard is built entirely in Excel using pivot tables, calculated fields and slicers.

## Dashboard Layout and KPIs

### 1. Executive Metrics (top left)

- **Sales** – total sales value (with year-over-year % change).
- **Quantity** – total units sold (with YoY % change).
- **Profit** – total profit (with YoY % change).

These three tiles give an instant view of performance and direction of change.

### 2. Sales Trend by Month

Line chart showing **monthly sales** across the year.

**Used for:**
- Spotting peak months (e.g., **December** as the best sales month).
- Identifying slow periods that may need promotions or campaigns.
- Comparing seasonality patterns across segments using slicers.

---

### 3. Shipping Mode Analysis

**Donut chart** for Ship Mode usage:
- First Class  
- Same Day  
- Second Class  
- Standard Class  

**Highlights:**
- Most frequently used shipping mode.
- Total order count by mode.

This helps understand cost vs. speed trade-offs and logistics behaviour.

---

### 4. Category Sales Breakdown

Horizontal bar chart summarising sales for key furniture categories:
- Tables  
- Furnishings  
- Chairs  
- Bookcases  

You can quickly see which category is leading (for example, **Chairs** with the highest sales) and where there’s room to grow.

---

### 5. Shipping Duration

Column chart of **delivery time in days** (0–7 days):

- Shows how many orders fall into each delivery-time bucket.
- Identifies the most common delivery window (e.g. most orders delivered in 4 days).
- Useful for tracking service level and customer experience.

---

### 6. Shipping Distribution by State

Map visual of the **United States**:

- Colours indicate sales volume by state.
- Key insight: which states contribute the most (e.g. **California** with the highest sales).

Great for regional targeting, territory planning and marketing focus.

---

### 7. Top 10 Selling Cities

Bar chart of **Top 10 Cities by Sales**:

- Ranks cities by revenue (e.g. **New York City** as #1).
- Helps prioritise high-value locations for campaigns, inventory and account management.

## Possible Extensions

If you want to take this further:

- Add **profit by category and region** to show margin, not just sales.
- Introduce **customer segment analysis** (Consumer, Corporate, Home Office).
- Build a **scenario or what-if sheet** (e.g. impact of discount or shipping changes).
- Recreate the dashboard in **Power BI** or **Tableau** for richer interactivity.
